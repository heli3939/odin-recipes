    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The legend goes that Tartare tribes when fighting in the past didn't even
        have time to stop and cook their food. They are said to have kept the
        meat underneath their saddles and mince it in this way.
        <br>Today this dish is a gourmet classic. This dish is eaten like a pate,
        spread on a piece of warm toast with fresh tomato and onion rings on top.
        <br>It is very important though to make sure that both the meat and the
        egg are very fresh because they are eaten raw.
    </p>
