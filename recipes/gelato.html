    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 egg yolks</li>
        <li>Â½ cup sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Warm until foam forms 
            around the edges. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar until frothy in a large bowl. Gradually
             pour warm milk into egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. 
             <br> Return mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a
              wooden spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the 
              back of the spoon.  <br> If small egg lumps begin to show, 
              remove from heat immediately.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture through a sieve or fine strainer into a bowl. 
            Cover, and chill for 2 hours to overnight.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to 
            the manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, 
            and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.</li>
    </ol>
